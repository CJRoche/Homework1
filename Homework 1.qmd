### Cars data

For this homework the **mtcars** package is loaded in and the the mpg variable is plotted against the weight variable. The plot shows that there is a negative relationship between the miles per gallon of a car and its weight. In the figure, automatic cars are represented in [red]{style="color: red;"}, and manual in [green]{style="color: green;"}.

```{r}

#| label: mpg by weight
# the mtcars data is loaded in
data(mtcars)
# the mpg and weight are plotted with colours and axis lables added to the plot.
plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$wt, col = (mtcars$am + 2), pch = 19, 
     xlab = "miles per gallon", ylab = "weight") 
# A legend is added to the plot
legend("topright", legend = c("Automatic", "Manual"), col = 2:3, pch = 19)

```
